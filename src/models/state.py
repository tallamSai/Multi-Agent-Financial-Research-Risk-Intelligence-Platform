    # Complexity classification (Sprint 7.6): "simple_lookup" (single-fact retrieval,
    # fast path) vs "research_required" (multi-section synthesis, calc with formula,
    # comparative — routed to the research agent subgraph). None means classifier
    # didn't set it (treat as simple_lookup downstream).

    # --- Entity extraction (Sprint 7a.v2) ---
    # Lowercase slug matching a `company` payload value in Qdrant, or None if the
