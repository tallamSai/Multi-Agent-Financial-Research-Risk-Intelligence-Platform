"""Entity extractor — pre-retrieval company + fiscal year detection.

Problem this solves (surfaced in Sprint 7a): hybrid retrieval (dense + BM25)
returns chunks from the wrong company because all 10-Ks share terminology.
Asking "Apple operating income" pulls Microsoft's chunks too.

Fix: extract the target entity from the query *before* retrieval, and pass it
as a Qdrant payload filter alongside RBAC. Retrieval then physically cannot
return cross-company chunks.

Strategy: two-tier for latency + cost control.
  1. Dictionary/regex pass — deterministic, zero LLM cost, handles 90% of cases
     (explicit mentions, common tickers).
  2. Groq LLM fallback — only when the dictionary pass is ambiguous (e.g.
     pronoun follow-ups "what about their R&D?", or multi-entity mentions).

Emits `target_company` (lowercase slug or None) and `target_fiscal_year`
(integer or None) into state.
